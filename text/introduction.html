<h4>What is a Neural Network?</h4>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\require{mhchem}\)</span>The figure on
the upper right is a schematic of a small neural network that accepts
two inputs, perhaps pH and temperature, and returns a single output,
perhaps %yield. In between the inputs and the output are two bias terms
and a hidden layer with two nodes. Weights—shown as arrows—connect nodes
in the hidden layer to the nodes in the input and output layers
(including the bias terms). A neural network is trained by presenting it
with samples that have known inputs and outputs and adjusting the
weights until the difference between the known and predicted outputs is
sufficiently small. Once trained, the network is used to predict the
outcome of new samples that it hasn’t yet seen.</p>

<div id="what-does-it-mean-to-feedforward-and-to-backpropagate" class="section level4">
<h4>What Does it Mean to Feed–Forward and to Backpropagate?</h4>
<p>Training a neural network occurs in two ways: feeding–forward inputs
and backpropagating errors. Feeding–forward means information flows from
inputs to outputs. The difference between the output and its expected
value is an error. To improve the neural network’s capabilities, this
error is used to adjust all of the network’s weights, working in the
reverse direction, a process called backpropagation.</p>

<div id="how-do-we-model-a-neuron" class="section level4">
<h4>How Do We Model a Neuron?</h4>
<p>A neural network is a simple mathematical model of a physiological
neuron in which dendrites carry signals to a cell body that processes
and passes the signals to an axon. The figure on the lower right is a
schematic of an artificial neuron: the neuron’s cell body is a node, the
dendrites are the node’s inputs, and the axon is the node’s output. The
summation symbol, <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, indicates
that the inputs and their weights are combined mathematically. The
S-shaped symbol represents an activation function that is applied before
the node’s value is sent to the next layer.</p>
