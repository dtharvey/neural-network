<h4>What is a Neural Network?</h4>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\require{mhchem}\)</span>A neural network
uses a supervised machine learning algorithm to discover an underlying
structure in a set of data. The figure on the upper right is a simple
neural network that accepts two inputs and returns a single output. A
hidden layer with three nodes connects the input nodes to the output
node. Weights connect each node in the hidden layer to all nodes in the
input and output layers. A neural network is trained by presenting it
with samples that have known inputs and outputs—that these are known is
why this is a supervised method—and adjusting the weights until the
difference between the known and predicted outputs is sufficiently
small. Once trained, the network is used to predict the outcome of new
experiments.</p>

<h4>What Does it Mean to Feed-Forward and to Backpropogate?</h4>
<p>As suggested in the figure, training a a neural network occurs in two
ways: first by feeding-forward and then by backpropogating. Feed-forward
means information flows from inputs to outputs. The difference between
the output and its expected value is an error. To improve the neural
network’s capabilities, this error is used to adjust the weights,
working in the reverse direction, a process called backpropogation.</p>

<h4>How Do We Model a Neuron?</h4>
<p>A neural network uses a simple model of a neuron in which dendrites
carry signals to a cell body that processes and passes the signals to an
axon. The figure on the lower right shows an artificial neuron. In this
model the neuron’s cell body is a node, the dendrites are the node’s
inputs, and the axon is the node’s output. The summation symbol, <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, indicates that the inputs and
their weights are combined mathematically. The S-shaped symbol
represents an activation function that is applied before the node’s
value is sent to the next layer.</p>
