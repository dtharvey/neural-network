<h4>Training</h4>
<p>There are three important training variables: the number of training
samples, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the size of weight
adjustments (the learning rate, <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>), and how many times the set of
training samples passes through the neural network (epochs). The
controls on the right allow you to explore how each variable affects
training: the sliders for <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> and
epochs use a log scale; when <span class="math inline">\(n = 1\)</span>
the first row of the XOR logic gate’s truth table is the training
sample, and when <span class="math inline">\(n = 4\)</span> all four
rows of the truth table are training samples. The accompanying figure
shows how the error changes with each step through the network. When
using four training samples you can overlay the average error for each
epoch.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Set <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(0.001\)</span>, epochs to <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>, and one training sample. Step through
epochs from <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(10,000\)</span> and describe how the error changes
during training.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. Set <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(0.001\)</span>, epochs to <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span>, and one training sample. Step
through <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(0.001\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and describe how the error changes
during training.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. Set <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(0.1\)</span> and epochs to <span class="math inline">\(10,000\)</span>. Change <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> and escribe how the error changes
during training.</p>

<div id="testing" class="section level4">
<h4>Testing</h4>
<p>After training a network, we evaluate its predictive ability by
presenting it with test samples that have known inputs and outputs and
record the error. The radio button on the bottom right use the rows in
the XOR logic gate’s truth table as test samples in the form <span class="math inline">\(I_1 / I_2 / t\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong>. Return to Exercises 1–3 and examine the
predictions and errors for each training sample. What do you notice
about your results?</p>
