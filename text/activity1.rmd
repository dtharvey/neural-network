The template on the right is a neural network with two input nodes, $I_1$ and $I_2$, three nodes in a hidden layer, $H_1$, $H_2$, and $H_3$, and a single output node, $O_1$. Weights connect each node to the nodes above it and the nodes below it; thus, $W_{2,1}$ is the weight between $I_2$ and $H_1$, and $V_2$ is the weight between $H_2$ and $O_1$. Select the radio button labeled initial set-up to show one possible initial state for the network. The inputs of $0.600$ and $0.400$ are from a training sample that has an expected output---or target---of $0.200$. The weights are drawn from a random uniform distribution with limits of $\frac{\pm 1}{\sqrt{n}}$, where $n$ is the number of nodes that feed into a weight.

**Exercise 1**. Verify that the initial weights are consistent with the description above.

**Exercise 2**. In a feed-forward neural network, a node's initial value is a weighted sum of the inputs and weights that feed into it; thus $H_1 = I_1 \times W_{1,1} + I_2 \times W_{21} = 0.377$. Why is a weighted sum a reasonable estimate for a node's initial value? Calculate the initial value for $H_2$ and for $H_3$.

**Exercise 3**. An activation function limits nodes in the hidden layer and the output layer to a narrow range of possible values. A sigmoidal function, $f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$, is a common choice where $x$ is a node's weighted sum. Explain why this function is limited to values between $0$ and $1$.

**Exercise 4**. Applying a sigmoidal activation function to the weighted sum for $H_1$ changes its value from $0.377$ to $0.593$. Verify this result and then calculate the effect of a sigmoidal activation function on $H_2$ and $H_3$. *Note: The boxes for the hidden layer and the output layer include both the weighted sum (top) and its value after applying the transfer function (bottom)*.

**Exercise 5**. The feed-forward process for the output layer follows the same rules: calculate the weighted sum for the output node and then apply a sigmoidal activation function. Calculate the output node's value and check your work by selecting the radio button labeled after feed-forward.
